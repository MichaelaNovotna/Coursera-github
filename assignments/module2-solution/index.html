  		<p>Put a large pot of salted water on to boil and heat olive oil in a large sauté pan. Add bacon and cook slowly until crispy. Add garlic, then turn off the heat and put the bacon and garlic into a large bowl. In a small bowl, beat eggs and mix in cheese. Add dry pasta into the boiling water, and cook at a rolling boil. When the pasta is al dente, use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly. Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt and serve with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper.</p>
